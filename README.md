### Project Description: EEG Data Analysis and Classification

**Project Overview:**
This project involves the analysis of EEG (Electroencephalography) data collected during a mental arithmetic task. The primary objective is to classify different cognitive states (rest vs. task) using advanced deep learning techniques. The dataset comprises EEG recordings from subjects before and during a mental arithmetic task, divided into two performance-based groups. This project includes data preprocessing, power spectral density (PSD) analysis, feature extraction,
